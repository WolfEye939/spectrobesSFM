the following is set up like this:

the src folder contains 2 directories; "mdl-src" and "mtl-src". "mdl-src" contains smd and DMX type meshes that were direct conversions from my personal dumped copy of spectrobe origins. you are free to modify them in any way you wish.
it also contains the QC scripts that tell the compiler the way to make the files usable for the source engine.

the "mtl-src" directory simply contains textures for the models. KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE BELONG TO DISNEY, SO KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE MODIFYING THEM.

The "Usermod" directory is probably what you came for: its the product that can be usable in SFM. simply drag and drop the usermod directory to the "game" directory found wherever you have SFM installed.

WHen you make art with this model pack, all I ask is you link this github repository or my github profile for making the port.
